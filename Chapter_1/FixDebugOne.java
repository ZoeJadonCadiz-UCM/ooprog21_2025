/*
 * List down the spotted bugs below:
 * 
 * Bugs:
 * 1. The class name is invalid as it shouldn't contain spaces. It should be one as FixDebugOne
 * 2. Main method shouldn't be capitalized. It should be public static void main, not Main.
 * 3. There is no array [] in public static void main (String args)
 * 4. Typo in Systm.out.println (It should be complete as System.out.println)
 * 5. There is no semicolon after the java statement System.out.println
 * 6. There is no closed curly bracket for the class name.
